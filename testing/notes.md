# Testing Methodologies
## Functional Testing
* Unit Testing
* Integration/System Testing
* Acceptance Testing
* Regression Testing

## Non functional Testing
* Performance Testing
* Load Testing
* Stress Testing
* Volume Testing
* Security Testing
* Usability Testing
* Compatibility Testing
* Installation Testing
* Uninstallation Testing
* Recovery Testing
* Documentation Testing

## Unit Testing
* Unit testing is part of the software development process in which small parts of an application, called units, are individually tested for proper operation. Unit testing can be done manually but is often automated in Agile and DevOps projects.

## Integration/System Tests
* Integration testing is the part in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. It occurs after unit testing and before functional testing

## Functional Tests
* After the integration tests are performed, more complex levels of tests are used. The functional testing process in which software is tested to ensure that it conforms with all business requirements and to ensure that it has all the required functionality for the software to be used by the end user without issues

## Regression Tests
* Regression testing verifies that software which was developed in previous releases still performs correctly after it was changed, changes may include software enhancements, compliance, bug fixes etc

## Acceptance Tests
* Acceptance Testing is where a system is tested for acceptability by the end user. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery into production
