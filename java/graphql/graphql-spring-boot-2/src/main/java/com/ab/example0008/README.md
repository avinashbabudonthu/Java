# Mutation
* In this mutation operation we are simulating `crateStudent` operation
* Create [Student](Student0008.java) class
* Create [StudentResponse](StudentResponse0008.java) class
* Write [Mutation](Mutation.java) class
* `createStudent` method in [Mutation](Mutation.java) class
* create [mutation.graphqls](../../../../resources/mutation.graphqls) file
* We can declare mutation operation in `schema.graphqls` also. But it is good practice to separate `query` and `mutation` operations
* `createStudent` in [mutation.graphqls](../../../../resources/mutation.graphqls) file
* `Student0008` in [mutation.graphqls](../../../../resources/mutation.graphqls) file
* `StudentResponse0008` in [mutation.graphqls](../../../../resources/mutation.graphqls) file
