# Notes
* every single software entity (class or method) should have only single reason to change
* If given class (or method) does multiple operations then it is advisable to seperate into distinct classes (or methods)
* It can be done easily with the help of interfaces
* Each class or method handle just a single responsibility

# Example1
* Modify [Example1](Example1.java) class to SRP
* [Solution1](Solution1.java)
