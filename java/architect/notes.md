# Career path
* Software architect
* Application architect
* Technical architect
* Solutions architect
* Enterprise architect

## Software architect
* architect has no specific responsibilities that differ from any software developers.  He just has more authority and influence

## Application architect
* Application architect has responsibility for an application.  If you work for a software company, this may be a product line.  It might also be some kind of internal software
* you have a team of software developers that works on some application and then an application architect who works closely with them

## Solutions architect
* Where an application architect’s purview is (broadly speaking) a codebase, a solution architect generally has less granular responsibilities.  This can certainly span multiple codebases

## Enterprise architect
* solution architect to see what they do and the granularity at which they focus.  Where solution architects work with an ecosystem of products comprising a “solution,” enterprise architects work with the whole organization
