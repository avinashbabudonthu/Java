# Essential components of production microservices
* API Gateway: Provides unified entry point for client applications. It handles routing, filtering and load balancing
* Service Registry: Contains details of all microservices. Gateway disovers services using registry. Examples: Consul, Eureka, Zookeeper etc
* Service Layer: Each micorservices serves specific business function and can run on multiple instances. These services can be built using frameworks like Spring Boot, Node JS etc
* Authorization server: Used to secure microservices. Manage identity and access control. Tools like KeyCloak, Azure AD, Okta
* Data storage: Databases like Postgre SQL, MySQL can store application data generated by services
* Distributed caching: Caching is greate approach for boosting application performance. Option include caching solutions like Redis, Couchbase, Memcached etc
* Async microservices communication: Use platforms such as kafka, RabbitMQ to support async communication between microservices
* Metrics visualization: Microservices can be configured to publish metrics to Prometheus and tools like Grafana can help visualize the metrics
* Log aggregation and visualization: Logs generated by microservices can be aggregated using LogStash, stored in Elasticsearch and visualize with Kibana
