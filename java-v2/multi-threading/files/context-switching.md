# Context Switching in Java
* In Java, context switching refers to the process of storing the state of one thread and loading the state of another thread so that the CPU can switch between executing different threads.
* Here's a breakdown of context switching in Java:
* What is Context Switching?
	* When a thread is running on the CPU, it has a certain `context` associated with it. This context includes the values of its registers, the program counter (which tells the CPU where to execute next), and the stack (which stores local variables and function call information).
	* Context switching occurs when the operating system decides to pause the execution of one thread and start executing another thread.
	* To do this, the OS saves the context of the current thread and loads the context of the next thread.

# Types of Context Switching
* Thread Context Switching
	* This occurs when the CPU switches between different threads within the same process. It's a relatively fast operation.
* Process Context Switching
	* This occurs when the CPU switches between different processes. It's a slower operation compared to thread context switching, as it involves saving and loading more state information.

# How Does Java Handle Context Switching?
* Java itself does not perform context switching. It relies on the underlying operating system to manage threads and context switching.
* The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) provides an abstraction layer that allows Java threads to be mapped to operating system threads.
* When you create a new thread in Java using the `Thread` class, the JVM creates a corresponding operating system thread.
* The OS then manages the scheduling and execution of these threads, including context switching.

# Impact of Context Switching
* Context switching is an overhead that consumes CPU time
* Too many context switches can degrade application performance
* In Java, factors like excessive thread creation, contention for shared resources (locks), and improper thread synchronization can lead to increased context switching

# Minimizing Context Switching:
* Limit Thread Creation
	* Create threads only when necessary and use thread pools to manage them efficiently.
* Use Synchronization Carefully
	* Minimize the use of locks and synchronize only critical sections of code to reduce contention.
* Optimize Thread Priorities
	* Assign appropriate priorities to threads based on their importance.
* Avoid Busy Waiting
	* Use wait/notify mechanisms instead of busy waiting to avoid unnecessary CPU cycles.

# Summary
* In summary, context switching is a crucial part of multitasking in Java, but excessive context switching can hurt performance. By understanding how it works and using appropriate techniques, you can minimize its impact and ensure your Java applications run smoothly.
